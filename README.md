# My Web Page

You can see my web in https://laurajaimevillamayor.000webhostapp.com/

The technologies I have used have been HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. 
I have also used some javascript to renderized and decorated the web.

Below are the .js used:

* [Bootstrap.min.js](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/)
* [appear.js](https://github.com/bas2k/jquery.appear/). jQuery plugin to call a function when an element appears. Is important for skills bars.
* [isotope.pkgd.min.js](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/). Isotope is a package which applies fliters in order to an argument in the HTML class. Like that: data-filter=".web" where ".web" is a filter.
* main.js. Important for all animation in web.
