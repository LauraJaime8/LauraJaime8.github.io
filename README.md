# My Web Page

You can see my web in https://laurajaimevillamayor.000webhostapp.com/

The technologies I have used have been HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. 
I have also used some javascript to renderized and decorated the web.

Below are the .js used:

* [Bootstrap.min.js](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/)
* html5shiv.js
* jquery.nicescroll.min.js
* showHide.js
* scrolling-nav.js
