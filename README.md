# My Web Page

You can see my web in https://laurajaimevillamayor.000webhostapp.com/

The technologies I have used have been HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap. 
I have also used some javascript to renderized and decorated the web.

Below are the .js used:

* [Bootstrap.min.js](http://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/download/)
* [html5shiv.js](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv) .The HTML5 Shiv enables use of HTML5 sectioning elements in legacy Internet Explorer and provides basic HTML5      styling for Internet Explorer 6-9, Safari 4.x (and iPhone 3.x), and Firefox 3.x.
* [jquery.nicescroll.min.js](https://github.com/inuyaksa/jquery.nicescroll/releases). Is a jQuery Plugin for custom scrollbars on mobile and desktop browsers.
* scrolling-nav.js. Is a jQuery to collapse the navbar on scroll.
* [appear.js](https://github.com/bas2k/jquery.appear/). jQuery plugin to call a function when an element appears.
* [isotope.pkgd.min.js](https://isotope.metafizzy.co/). Isotope is a package which applies fliters in order to an argument in the HTML class. Like that: data-filter=".web" where ".web" is a filter.
